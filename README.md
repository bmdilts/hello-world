# hello-world
My first GitHub repository... gotta start somewhere!

Hi all!  I'm excited to start the Iron Yard tomorrow, May 22nd. 
But, that means I'm a noob, beginner, pleb, novice... etc.
So, I'm here to build my portfolio and showcase my work to peers, instructors, 
and hopefully potential employers!
